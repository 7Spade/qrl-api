User request: Adjust project structure per documentation files (ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md, 調整結構.md, 網頁結構.md, 結構調整.md, 結構.md) without breaking functionality. Use Sequential Thinking and tools (Context7, planning) as needed. Maintain code equivalence, update structure docs, keep files under 4000 chars, validate functionality after changes, and report progress with minimal modifications.
